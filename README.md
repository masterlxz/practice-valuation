# Practice Valuation

A personal desktop app for tracking B3 stock and crypto investment theses — fair-price valuation
models plus a crypto scoring dashboard, replacing a spreadsheet.

## Why

Tracking "is this stock cheap?" across several valuation methods, each with its own assumptions,
outgrows a spreadsheet fast — especially when you want to keep more than one calculation per asset
(different growth-rate assumptions, compared side by side) and get notified automatically when an
asset crosses into a "buy zone." This app replaces that spreadsheet with a small local database and
a UI built around exactly that workflow.

## What it does

- **7 stock valuation models**: Bazin, Graham, Gordon/DDM, DCF/FCFF, Banks (P/B–ROE–Gordon), RNAV,
  and Projected Ceiling Price — each with its own guarded inputs and pass/fail verdict.
- **Multiple saved valuations per ticker**, each with its own assumptions, browsable and comparable.
- **Crypto score dashboard**: a 9-indicator green/neutral/red score (TVL trend, net issuance,
  fees-vs-issuance, NVT ratio automated; the rest fall back to manual entry where no free data
  source exists).
- **Alerts**: register a price/indicator rule, a background check runs periodically, and a native
  OS notification fires when it triggers.
- **Stock Lookup**: search any B3 ticker for quote, fundamentals, technicals (SMA/CAGR), a
  dividend-history chart, and a free-text note — auto-fetches data on first search, cached after.
- **AI chat panel**: ask questions about your own saved valuations/alerts using your own Gemini,
  Claude, or OpenAI API key — read-only access to your data, key stored in the OS keyring.
- **(in progress)** Cross-device sync via [TruthID](https://github.com/masterlxz/truthid) + IPFS —
  no server operated by this project; see `PROJECT_STATE.md`, Fase 8.

## Architecture

| Component | Stack | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop app | Tauri + Rust + React/TypeScript | [`desktop/`](desktop/) |
| Data collector | Python (fetches quotes/fundamentals/crypto data) | [`data-collector/`](data-collector/) |
| Smart contract (sync, in progress) | Solidity (Foundry) | [`contracts/`](contracts/) |

The desktop app and the data collector never talk over a network or IPC — they just read and write
the same local SQLite file. The Rust side runs the collector as a subprocess on demand (a button in
the UI), not on a schedule.

## Building from source

**Desktop app** (Tauri + React, runs in Docker to avoid host toolchain setup):
```
cd desktop
./dev.sh
```

**Smart contracts** ([Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)):
```
cd contracts
forge build
forge test
```

## Status

This is a personal project built incrementally, session by session, at a background pace — not
every phase is finished. `PROJECT_STATE.md` at the repo root has the full roadmap, architecture
decisions, and session-by-session history.

## Security

- AI provider API keys live in the OS keyring, never in the SQLite database or in git.
- Your local SQLite database (actual valuations/portfolio data) is gitignored and never leaves your
  machine.
- This is a personal tool, not professionally audited — treat it as early-stage software.
